Alright so basic setup is here
https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice-v1/

Remember to run (mostly) everything with python 3! It was a basic mistake but it cost me a day of work.

Ok, so follow the direction in the booklet (Essentials_AIY_Projects_Voice_v1), they are pretty much correct, but a few edits are needed.

So cloudspeach_demo.py has been moved, from /src/ to /src/checkpoints

Also, you need to make some edits, cause stuff has broken due to updates.

In cloudspeech_demo.py, you need to edit these lines:

from google.cloud import speech_v1 as speech
...
END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE = speech.types.StreamingRecognizeResponse.SpeechEventType.END_OF_SINGLE_UTTERANCE
...
encoding=speech.types.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,

If you want to use a .desktop file in terminal, simple open it with nano and see where it leads.
